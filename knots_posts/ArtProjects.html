                    Voronoi Diagram Turtles!

                <p>
                    This project is a nice and relaxing art project. My intention was that it would help one get an intuition as to <b>why</b> Voronoi diagrams appear in nature.
                    Unfortutely, as the presentation was for high schoolers, I wasn't able to include as much of the rich mathematical theory surounding Voronoi diagrams (such as the duality between these and Delauney triangulations).
                    Still, my fellow college classmates enjoyed it, and found it relaxing, so I think there's something in it for anyone.
