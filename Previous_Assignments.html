            <p>
                Below is a list of classes for which I have shareable assignments from past classes. 
                By making these public I hope to showcase my skills in mathematical proofs and writing in case I apply for jobs or graduate schools.
                I also hope this will help anyone who is a self learner in math, and would like some (admitedly not entirely correct) examples.
            </p>
